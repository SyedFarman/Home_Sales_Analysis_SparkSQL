# Home_Sales_Analysis_SparkSQL
This project involves using SparkSQL to analyze home sales data and compute key metrics. The dataset includes information on home sales such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, square footage, year built, and sale price.

The project requires creating temporary views, partitioning data, caching and uncaching a temporary table, and verifying that the table has been uncached. The project will involve using Spark to load and process the data, creating temporary views to represent the data, partitioning the data for faster processing, and caching and uncaching temporary tables to optimize query performance.
